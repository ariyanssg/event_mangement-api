# Implementation.md

## 1. Architecture & Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Models, controllers, middleware, and routes are modular and independent, making the codebase easy to maintain and extend.
- **Validation**: All input is validated at the middleware layer using express-validator, with custom logic for dates, times, and IDs to prevent invalid or malicious data.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handler ensures consistent, secure error responses for all endpoints and error types (validation, cast, duplicate, JWT, etc.).
- **Security**: Helmet for HTTP headers, CORS for cross-origin, and express-rate-limit to prevent brute-force and DoS attacks.
- **Performance**: MongoDB indexes on key fields, efficient queries, and lean data models for fast response times.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable for more resources (users, bookings, etc.) and more endpoints.
- **Testing**: Structure supports easy addition of unit/integration tests. Seed script enables quick setup for test data.

## 2. Key Implementation Details

- **Event Model**: Rich validation (dates, times, image URLs, email, phone), virtual status field (upcoming/ongoing/completed), and indexes for query performance.
- **Restaurant Model**: Minimal, with required fields and email validation.
- **Controllers**: Each operation (add, update, get, delete) checks for existence, validates logic (e.g., time order), and returns clear, consistent responses.
- **Validation Middleware**: Reusable, covers all edge cases (invalid IDs, past dates, negative fees, etc.).
- **Seed Script**: Allows quick setup for demo/testing with sample data.

## 3. API Design

- **RESTful**: Follows REST conventions for resource management.
- **Consistent Responses**: All endpoints return a standard JSON structure with `success`, `message`, `data`, and (where relevant) `count` or `errors`.

## 4. Security & Best Practices

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data (DB URI, API base URL) is never hardcoded.
- **Production Readiness**: Handles connection errors, 404s, and unexpected exceptions gracefully.
- **Extensibility**: New features (e.g., authentication, more resources) can be added with minimal refactoring.

## 5. How to Extend

- Add authentication (JWT, OAuth)
- Add more resources (users, bookings)
- Add more granular permissions (admin/user roles)
- Add automated tests (Jest, Supertest)
- Add CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment

## 6. Test Scripts

- **test-api.ps1**: End-to-end test script for all CRUD operations, including seeding, creating, updating, and deleting events. Handles errors and prints detailed responses.
- **test-update-only.ps1**: Focuses on update operation, including creation and cleanup of a test event.

## 7. Interview Talking Points

- **Architecture**: Emphasize modularity, separation of concerns, and how each layer (model, controller, middleware, route) contributes to maintainability.
- **Validation & Security**: Discuss how you prevent bad data and attacks (input validation, rate limiting, CORS, Helmet).
- **Error Handling**: Centralized, consistent, and secure error responses.
- **Performance**: Use of MongoDB indexes, efficient queries, and lean models.
- **Extensibility**: How you'd add authentication, more endpoints, or new features.
- **Testing**: Structure supports easy addition of tests; mention the seed script for test data.
- **DevOps**: Environment variables, production readiness, and how to deploy (Heroku, Vercel, etc.).
- **Accessibility & UX**: If you build a frontend, mention WCAG, responsive design, and accessibility best practices.

## 8. Example Interview Q&A

**Q: How do you ensure data integrity and security in your API?**
A: All input is validated using express-validator and custom logic. Security is enforced with Helmet, CORS, and rate limiting. Sensitive data is managed via environment variables.

**Q: How would you add authentication?**
A: Add JWT-based middleware, protect routes, and extend the user model. Use Passport.js or custom middleware for role-based access.

**Q: How is error handling managed?**
A: All errors are caught by a centralized error handler, which returns consistent, secure responses and hides stack traces in production.

**Q: How would you scale this project?**
A: Add more resources, use connection pooling, add caching (Redis), and deploy with horizontal scaling (Docker, Kubernetes).

**Q: How do you test your API?**
A: Manual tests with cURL/Postman and automated scripts (PowerShell). The structure supports Jest/Supertest for automated testing.
